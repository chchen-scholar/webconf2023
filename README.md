# Scope
In recent years, the techniques of Internet of Things (IoT) and Web of Things (WoT) have been more and more popular to collect sensing data and build intelligent services and applications. Some organizations (e.g., oneM2M, Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF), IEEE, etc.) were instituted to establish the standards and specifications of IoT for building an IoT ecosystem. These standards and specifications discuss the issues of data models, unique identification of things, service descriptions and dependencies, discovery, trust management, and real-time control and cyber-physical systems. For instance, OCF designed discovery and advertisement mechanisms to send multicast packets to find the adapted devices which include the target interface in wireless local area network based on IEEE 802.11 or personal area network based on IEEE 802.15 for building a self-organizing network. The devices can follow the data models and control methods in specifications to control other OCF devices for IoT applications. However, the communications among the different techniques of IoT standards and specifications are the important challenges. Therefore, the interoperation of services across platforms based on different IoT standards and specifications needs to be investigated. For example, the Interworking Proxy Entity (IPE) was designed to establish the connection of oneM2M, OCF, and Lightweight M2M in oneM2M's Release 2. The WoT defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) focuses on the web technologies for the combination and interoperation of the IoT with the web of data. Developers can use the techniques of WoT to collect the sensing data and control the devices via different IoT standards and specifications for the applications of agriculture, energy, enterprise, finance, healthcare, industry, public services, residency, retail, and transportation.

Furthermore, Deep learning techniques (e.g. neural network (NN), convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), etc.) have been popularly applied into image recognition and time-series inference for IoT and WoT applications. Advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous cars, for instance, have been developed based on the machine learning and deep learning techniques, which perform the forward collision warning, blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning, traffic sign recognition, traffic safety, infrastructure management and congestion, and so on. Autonomous cars can share their detected information (e.g. traffic signs, collision events, etc.) with other cars via vehicular communication systems (e.g. dedicated short range communications (DSRC), vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), long term evolution (LTE), and the 5th generation mobile networks) for cooperation. However, how to enhance the performance and efficiency of these deep learning techniques is one of the big challenges for implementing these real-time applications. Several optimization techniques (e.g. stochastic gradient descent algorithm (SGD), adaptive moment estimation algorithm (Adam), Nesterov-accelerated Adaptive Moment Estimation (Nadam), etc.) have been proposed to support deep learning algorithms for faster solution searching, e.g., the gradient descent method is a popular optimization technique to quickly seek the optimized weight sets and filters of CNN for image recognition. The IoT and WoT applications based on these image recognition techniques (e.g. autonomous cars, augmented reality navigation systems, etc.) have gained considerable attention, and the mathematical modeling and optimization problem in deep learning can be investigated and developed to support a variety of IoT and WoT applications.
